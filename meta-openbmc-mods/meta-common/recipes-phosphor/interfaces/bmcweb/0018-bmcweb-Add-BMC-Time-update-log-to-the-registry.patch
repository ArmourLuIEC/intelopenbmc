Subject: [PATCH] Add BMC Time update log to the registry

Add message in registry to log an event that indicates BMC time
is set via NTP, Host or Manually.
During early stage of system boot if any critical events occur,
they are getting logged with 1970 timestamp till the time BMC
time update happens. This is expected behavior, but to call it out
explicitly it is good to log when BMC time is updated.

Tested:
Built and validator passes.
Confirmed that the event is getting logged correctly in Redfish.
